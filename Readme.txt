Our old development/brainstorming notes:

Make new trails dragable back to the original list
Displaying associative links in visual trails
trails look like branches
Link back to the trail once you create it
Another frame that shows the saved trails
Capture where on the webpage that influenced the next part of the trail
Notes field for particular trail (use Delicious' own
Sub trails (i.e. trail 2.1)
